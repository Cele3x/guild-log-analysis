# Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the Guild Log Analysis application. The registry-based system automatically logs boss analysis registration and execution details.

## Log Files

- `wow_analysis.log` - Main application log
- `debug.log` - Debug-level logging (when enabled)
- `error.log` - Error-only logging

## Configuration

Log level and file location can be configured via environment variables:

```bash
WOW_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
WOW_LOG_FILE=logs/wow_analysis.log
```

## Log Rotation

Consider setting up log rotation for production use to prevent log files from growing too large.

## Troubleshooting

Enable debug logging for detailed troubleshooting:

```bash
export WOW_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```
